# Course Assignment: Social Media Prototype

## Description

This project leverages API functionality to create a prototype for a social media application (SOME). The objective was to develop a working prototype that includes essential features such as user registration, login, creating posts, editing posts, deleting posts, and retrieving postsâ€”all accomplished without the use of frameworks or UI libraries. The project was completed over the course of one week.

## Key Features of the Prototype

## Planning

The planning phase involved using GitHub Projects to create a task list, organizing tasks, and breaking them down into smaller, manageable components to enhance workflow efficiency.

## Development Choices and Solutions

During development, I chose to retrieve user data from `localStorage` to minimize server requests, resulting in faster data access and improved user experience. Regular expressions (Regex) were utilized for validation purposes, and I opted to write the post card logic in JavaScript to maintain readability and modularity. Instead of a lengthy file, smaller, reusable functions were created. Additionally, I used `document.createElement` for generating HTML elements to explore different methodologies.

## CSS

Some CSS was integrated to differentiate posts visually and gain better control over the layout. The current styling is prototype-level and will not be used in the final product. Placeholder images were implemented in JavaScript to address issues with excessively large images. Future styling will focus on creating a more engaging design.

## Documentation

I utilized JSDoc for documenting the code and ESLint for error-checking, both of which proved to be invaluable for maintaining code quality and consistency.

## Bugs

One significant challenge encountered was related to asynchronous operations. If a function was executed before the router fully loaded, the application would crash without error messages, complicating the debugging process. This highlighted the importance of managing asynchronous code effectively.

## Future Enhancements

Several additional pages and features were planned but not implemented in this prototype. These will be revisited as the project transitions from prototype to a fully-fledged product, including styled buttons that are ready for integration in future iterations.

## Conclusion

This project has been an enriching experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and API interactions while adhering to best practices in software development. I look forward to expanding on this prototype and transforming it into a social media application.
